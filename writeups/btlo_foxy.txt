Q1) The SOC recently observed network connections from 3 internal hosts towards hxxp://45.63.126[.]199/dot.gif (URL has been sanitized). What is this activity likely related to? (2 points)
From this we have two specific indicators: ip 45.63.126.199 and dot.gif. Since the latter is quite an obscure indicator, we will focus on the IP address
first. https://threatfox.abuse.ch, use ioc:45.63.126.199 and you will get that is a _cobalt strike_ beacon type of malware.

Q2) How many URLs are using the same endpoint 'dot.gif', across all export files? (include duplicates) (2 points)
Since this is asked for _all_ files, we can use grep within the ThreatFox directory:
cat '~/Desktop/ThreatFox Exports/*' | grep -c "dot.gif"
answer: 586
