            Today we will be walking through one of the Blue Team Labs Online Investigations: Foxy. The Investigation is rated as <b>"Hard"</b> and will earn you <b>100 points</b> upon 
            succesful completion. To earn full points, you have to answer 17 questions in regard to the following scenario:
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
              <div class="highlight">
                <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">In the heart of a bustling city, nestled within a sleek, glass-paneled building, the cybersecurity operations center of TechGuard Solutions was alive with the hum of activity. It was a typical Thursday afternoon, the air filled with the quiet rhythm of a well-oiled machine, until an unexpected alert shattered the routine calm. At precisely 2:15 PM, an alarm specifically linked to the user account “pbeesly” echoed through the center's advanced monitoring systems. The giant screen at the front of the room lit up with flashing red lights, signaling a potential security breach. Dan, the team lead, known for his years of experience and keen threat hunting skills, swiftly called his team to attention. "Team, we've got a situation," he declared, his gaze locked onto the ominous red blinks. The account “PBEESLY” had been on their radar for a few days. The user had submitted a ticket recently, reporting an incident involving a suspicious email. According to the ticket, PBEESLY had accidentally opened the email, which was followed by a fleeting appearance of a strange black screen. This unusual activity had raised initial concerns, but now, with the alarm triggered, it was clear that the situation was more serious than a mere phishing attempt. ITS HUNTING TIME!</pre>

            After opening Kibana, we browse to the Discover tab and look at the available fields in the left hand pane of Kibana. Here we identify the availability
            of the field <span id="inline-code">User</span>. When we filter on this field, we are presented with some of the values, amongst which <span id="inline-code">DMEVALS\\pbeesly</span>.
            This is likely the user account of the "pbeesly" user, however, to ensure we hit all records, we add a second filter with wildcards around the username. Eventually,
            we end up with a total of <span id="inline-code">790 log records</span>.

                </div>
            </div> 
            When we stay within the previous view, displaying only the logs corresponding to the "pbeesly" user, and we sort the logs ascending, starting with a view
            of the oldest logs, we see that the first log contains a SYSMON command line log, for the file <span id="inline-code">C:\ProgramData\Victim\â\u20ac®cod.3aka3.scr"</span>.
            Since this seems rather suspicious, especially if we then analyze the logs that follow which sees the creation of multiple processes involving <span id="inline-code">cmd.exe</span> and <span id="inline-code">powershell.exe</span>
            <img src="../img/cozybear_q2.png" alt="q2_answer">

            Note that due to the keyword "downloaded" in the question, one might have used the Downloads folder of the user "pbeesly". However, only two entries exists
            where the keyword "Downloads" is used in a CommandLine argument. Neither contribute to solving the question. Although the first log entry, shown below,
            might be relevant to answer a future question as it seems, based on a quick analysis, that it takes bytes from an image and converts it to a string hinting
            at a form of steganography.

                </div>
            </div> 
            Subsequently, if we analyze the first logfile and look for the ProcessGuid field, we obtain the answer to question 3: <span id="inline-code">{47ab858c-e13c-5eac-a903-000000000400}</span>.

            Now that we know that <span id="inline-code">C:\ProgramData\Victim\â\u20ac®cod.3aka3.scr"</span> is the malicious binary and it was executed from the user account of <span id="inline-code">DMEVALS\\pbeesly</span>,
            we can continue our hunt for network connections. Since we have access to the SYSMON logs, we can search for <a href="https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90003">Sysmon Event ID 3</a>
            which logs any network connection. To filter as specific as possible we set the ImageName to the malicious binary, the username to that of the pbeesly user and filter for the EventID. We are
            then left with one single log file for which we add the fieldnames <span id="inline-code">DestinationIp</span> and <span id="inline-code">DestinationPort</span>,
            giving us the answer: 192.168.0.5, 1234.

            Since we were only left with one single log entry, this question can be answered quite easily, since it is the timestamp that corresponds to the previously identified logfile:
            <span id="inline-code">May 1, 2020 @ 22:56:00.000</span>.

                </div>

            We know that the malicious binary that was launched had ProcessGuid <span id="inline-code">{47ab858c-e13c-5eac-a903-000000000400}</span>. We can filter for all processes that were created using
            this ProcessGuid as ParentProcessGuid filter, which would leave us with all child processes. This leaves us with four results. Twice, <span id="inline-code">conhost.exe</span>
            is called, and twice <span id="inline-code">cmd.exe</span> is called. If we follow the execution flow using the ProcessGuid from the first <span id="inline-code">cmd.exe</span>
            process, we discover that it then opens a <span id="inline-code">powershell</span> session, no subsequent processes seem to be created. If we follow the execution flow
            of the second <span id="inline-code">cmd.exe</span> process, we discover that <span id="inline-code">sdclt.exe</span> is called. A quick Google Search
            reveals <a href="https://pentestlab.blog/2017/06/09/uac-bypass-sdclt/">this blogpost</a> detailing that sdclt is used to perform backup and restoration operations
            and simultaneously can be used to bypass User Account Control ensuring privilege escalation. Therefore, we can conclude that the next binary that was launched was:
            <span id="inline-code">C:\windows\system32\sdclt.exe</span>.

                </div>
            </div> 
            Based on the blogpost that was mentioned during the previous question, we know that by performing this UAC bypass utilizing, the Control Panel will be launched
            as well. We can confirm if this also happens by using the ProcessGuid of <span id="inline-code">sdclt.exe</span> ({47ab858c-e1e3-5eac-b503-000000000400}) to search
            for child process, and we discover that indeed the control panel is launched: <span id="inline-code">C:\Windows\System32\control.exe</span>

                </div>
            </div> 
            This question is vaguely formulated and could be in relation to either <span id="inline-code">sdclt.exe</span> or <span id="inline-code">control.exe</span>.
            Either way, my assumption is that it is in connection to the UAC bypass chain and execution flow. If we focus our attention back on the blog post, it describes
            that if the UAC bypass is possible because the registry key <span id="inline-code">HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\control.exe</span>
            does not exist. However, no indication of creation of this registry key can be found. If we follow the log flow in chronological order, we see however that 
            <span id="inline-code">powershell.exe</span> is launched. Based on this, my hunch was that this is likely what is meant with the "original name of the binary" 
            that was launched through the UAC bypass. <span id="inline-code">PowerShell.exe</span>

          <h2 id="post__content__title">Hidden Payload File</h2>

                  <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">Q9) What is the file that contains the hidden payload? (Format: string.ext) (6 points)</pre>
                </div>
            </div> 
            If we retrace a couple of our steps, and we only filter for actions conducted by user "pbeesly", we know that already at question 2 discovered a potential hidden payload in an image.
            If we scroll through the timeline, we identify that this command was called directly after the UAC bypass was executed using <span id="inline-code">sdclt.exe</span>. Therefore, it is
            likely that the hidden payload is located in <span id="inline-code">monkey.png</span>. We filter specifically for any messages containing <span id="inline-code">monkey.png</span>
            and end up with 33 log entries. We see the original full command in multiple log entries and also note that the threat actor uses the specific registry: <span id="inline-code">HKCU:\Software\Classes\Folder\shell\open\command</span>"
            If we analyze the full command, we can conclude that bytes from the image are read, stored in a variable and then executed using the abbreviation <span id="inline-code">IEX</span> 
            which is short for <span id="inline-code">Invoke-Expression</span> which can be used to execute a string as a PowerShell command. Furthermore, through our filter, we additionally
            observe the CommandInvocation log for the <span id="inline-code">Invoke-Expression</span> command which points to a secondary payload.

                </div>
            </div> 
            As we discovered, the payload is located in <span id="inline-code">monkey.png</span>. In the screenshot for question 9, we see that in order to read(/execute) the payload in the image,
            the data needs to be read from the image. This is done using the .NET framework class <span id="inline-code">System.Drawing.Bitmap</span>.

                </div>
            </div> 
            Since the payload resided inside of "monkey.png" we can continue our hunt using this as a filter. If we apply the filter <span id="inline-code">Message: "monkey.png*" and "Invoke-Expression*"</span> we are left with 2 distinct events.
            The first is the payload transformation itself, and the second is the follow-on payload execution. 
            <img src="../img/cozybear_q11.png" alt="q11_subanswer">
            Those familiar with the shown result, immediately alert to the combined use of <span id="inline-code">VirtualAlloc</span> and <span id="inline-code">CreateThread</span>, which is peak malicious behaviour,

            happened at <span id="inline-code">May 1, 2020 @ 22:58:45.000</span>. We are going to use this timestamp as a starting point, and end about 20 seconds later at <span id="inline-code">May 1, 2020 @ 22:59:10</span>.
            Subsequently, we filter for Sysmon Event ID 1 which stands for process creation. Our first log entry is directly at <span id="inline-code">May 1, 2020 @ 22:58:45.000</span> and we
            observe the process <span id="inline-code">C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe /noconfig /fullpaths @"C:\Users\pbeesly\AppData\Local\Temp\qkbkqqbs\qkbkqqbs.cmdline"</span>.
            <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/">A quick Google search</a>, reveals that CSC is the C# compiler. Furthermore, if we combine
            that with a search for the ".cmdline" file, we discover that this is a <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/New+Tool+to+Add+to+Your+LOLBAS+List+cvtresexe/27892">known "living-off-the-land" technique</a>.
            Based on this information, we can conclude that the process/binary that was created after the hidden payload was executed, was <span id="inline-code">csc.exe</span>.

            Based on the information provided by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/">Microsoft</a> we know that csc is the C# compiler
            on Windows and it takes a file as its input to determine what to do. This file, in the logs, is called "qkbkqqbs.cmdline". However, since the question explicitely states ".commandline",
            I assume that this is a slight oversight and the correct answer is: <span id="inline-code">qkbkqqbs.commandline</span>.

                </div>
            </div> 
            Whilst looking for the answers to the questions above, I filtered for <span id="inline-code">Message: *monkey.png and Message: *File created*</span>.
            This returns 12 hits, and one of these details the creation of a new PowerShell process, when analyzing this specific log, I detected that a Token Elevation Type was used.
            More specifically, Token Elevation Type <span id="inline-code">%%1937</span>. Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4688">details</a>
            that this is a Type 2 token meaning it is an elevated token with no privileges removed or groups disabled. An elevated token is used when User Account Control is enabled and the user
            chooses to start the program using "Run as Administrator". Additionally, the log file added more details under the "Mandatory Label" section, namely: "S-1-16-12288". Since this is a short
            SID, I was under the impression this must signal something relevant. As expected, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/81d92bba-d22b-4a8c-908a-554ab29148ab">S-1-16-12288</a> is the value for a high integrity level process.
            Based on this, we can conclude that the attacker obtained elevation type %%1937 as the Administrator: <span id="inline-code">%%1937,Administrator</span>.

            By now we have gathered enough indicators to identify that we are actively investigating the TTPs and subsequent IOCs of APT-29, or as this challenge is fittingly named: Cozy Bear.

            action happened under the account of pbeesly. When logging this event, Microsoft additionally logs several details, amongst others the "Account Name", which we add to our filter. We
            remain with 5 events. If we closely examine these events, we notice that four of these are exactly the same, potentially hinting to multiple (re-)installs of the service. Regardless,
            two specific services got installed: <span id="inline-code">javamtsup.exe, PSEXESVC.exe</span>
