                        Today we will be walking through one of the Blue Team Labs Online Investigations: The Key. The Investigation is
                        rated as <b>"Hard"</b> and will earn you <b>100 points</b>. To earn full points, you have to answer 18 questions in regard to

He started a secret project at work without informing his Boss. Peter stored all the project files in his cloud account. His Boss came to know about Peter's secret project and asked the security team to investigate Peter's laptop. But, here comes the real headache, Peter's secret drive is encrypted!<br><br>Investigate the Disk, Help Boss in finding the Decryption Key and the Cloud Credentials of Peter.<br><br>Note: This investigation involves both Technical and Content Analysis.

                        The Windows Registry contains a wealth of information in regards to the operating system and numerous of its settings and locales. One of the datapoints
                        stored in the registry is information on the timezone that was set on the computer in question. To extract this value from the registry, we first have
                        to download the SYSTEM hive from the forensic image. Using FTK Imager, load the <span id="inline-code">E01</span> image. The SYSTEM hive by default is
                        located in <span id="inline-code">C:\Windows\System32\Config</span>. Download the hive and proceed to open the Forensic Registry EDitor (FRED) supplied
                        as a tool on the host. Next load the hive, and browse to the location <span id="inline-code">ControlSet001\Control\TimeZoneInformation</span>.
                        Identify the key <span id="inline-code">TimeZoneKeyName</span> which contains the value value <span id="inline-code">Pacific Standard Time</span>.

                        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                            <div class="highlight">

                            </div>
                        </div>
                        The attentive reader will focus their attention on "Peter's School" rather than on the "Superhero stories" part of the question. Those who have previously
                        setup a local-only account on a Windows system, might be familiar with <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/set-up-security-questions-as-your-verification-method-3d74aedd-88a5-4932-a211-9f0bfbab5de8">security questions</a>.
                        These security questions can be used to recover a lost account or a forgotten password. Windows requires users to submit at least three security questions with
                        corresponding answers. Additionally, Windows only allows a default set of questions, one of which asks for "What was the name of the first school you attended".
                        <br><br>
                        There are two ways in which the answers to the security questions can be retrieved. For both methods, we will need to access the SAM file. The SAM file is
                        a database file that stores user account details and is located at <span id="inline-code">C:\Windows\system32\config\SAM</span>.
                        <br>
                        The first method will use the NirLauncher. This is a utility-packed toolsuite that can be used in a whole host of scenarios and cases. Familiarize yourself
                        with the list of utilities and description as can be found on the <a href="https://launcher.nirsoft.net/utilities_list.html">NirLauncher website</a>. You
                        will identify a specific tool called <span id="inline-code">SecurityQuestionsView</span> which provides an interface to view the security questions and
                        their answers stored in the registry by the Windows 10 operating system. Loading the SAM file into the application, will show us that Peter went to
                        <span id="inline-code">The Cambridge School of West Coast</span>.
                        <br>
                        The second method will utilize the previously used FRED. Load the SAM database and go to Domains -> Account -> Users -> Names -> PeterDProgrammer ->
                        ResetData Key. Then decode the data from hex and discover the school Peter used to go to.

                        As opposed to question 2, this question doesn't leave us any clues and a hunt for something tangible that could lead the way to the answer begins.
                        In previous challenges that I have solved, sticky notes were used for similar questions. However, the sticky notes did not contain anything valuable.
                        After some painstaking time, I thought about the background image since people tend to use motivational or inspirational backgrounds. According to
                        multiple <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-10-where-is-the-background-photo-kept/4562c205-7af0-4a1c-b88f-ff94b847ed7d">sources</a>,
                        Windows stores the background image in the location <span id="inline-code">C:\Users\PeterDProgrammer\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\CachedFiles</span>.
                        As expected in the CachedFiles we discover an image and exporting it and opening it in an image viewer (e.g. Paint) will supply us with the quote:
                        <span id="inline-code">Empty Vessels Make The Most Noise</span>.

                        </div>
                        As discussed during question 1, the registry stores a lot of information on the operating system. We once again rely upon the SYSTEM hive to supply
                        us with the two answers for this question. Using FRED, we can locate the computername under <span id="inline-code">ControlSet001\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName</span>
                        and the IP address can be found be going through each interfaces under <span id="inline-code">ControlSet001\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\{365e6613-b9c3-420f-86e0-c00cd3602733}</span>

                        By browsing through the local folders in Peter's user folder, we identify the executable <span id="inline-code">python-3.9.4-amd64.exe</span> in the
                        Downloads folder. Additionally, in the Documents folder, a subfolder called "Programs" exists which hosts multiple python files. Furthermore, we
                        identify in <span id="inline-code">C:\Users\PeterDProgrammer\AppData\Roaming</span> that Peter uses Notepad++. Notepad++ keeps a backup folder where
                        sessions are stored. Within this folder, we identify one Notepad++ session which we can extract and view with a text editor. This session contains the
                        text: <span id="inline-code">starting my python journey</span>. As such, we can conclude that Peter is learning the Python programming language.

                        Based on question 5, we also identified a reference to creating a dayplan in the Notepad++ backup. However, no other notes can be found within Notepad++.
                        Simultaneously we see though, the Peter makes use of Sublime Text 3, which, much like Notepad++, is a text editor as well. So, the next logical step was
                        to look at the stored Sublime session(s) in <span id="inline-code">C:\Users\PeterDProgrammer\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Local\</span>. Within this
                        folder, we identify the existence of the file: <span id="inline-code">Session.sublime_session</span>. This file contains the tasks in Peter's Day Plan,
                        of which <span id="inline-code">Code to Save the world</span> is still in progress.

                        Since we already know the computername of Peter's computer, we can search for that value in the same logs we used to answer question 7.

                        </div>
                        The first step to answering this question, is identifying where said Password Manager is installed. In order, I investigated the <span id="inline-code">Program Files</span>
                        and <span id="inline-code">Program Files (x86)</span> folders, alongside Peter's <span id="inline-code">AppData</span> folder. When no indications of
                        Password Managers were found, I looked into the Prefetch files to identify if a Password Manager was executed and if that was done from outside one of
                        the previously mentioned locations. However no indications could be identified. Next, I decided to look for browser/internet-based Password Managers.
                        Working with the assumption that since no additional browsers are installed, the default browser on Windows, Edge, was used, I retrieved the browsing history.
                        It's history location file is stored at <span id="inline-code">C:\Users\PeterDProgrammer\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\History.sqlite</span>.
                        Extracting this SQLite database and opening it in DB Browser for SQLite, we browse to the urls table and find an entry for <span id="inline-code">https://lastpass.com/automatic-login</span>.
                        With this trivial piece of information in hand, we can conclude that Peter uses LastPass as a password manager.

                        Whilst searching for the Password Manager software on the local system as mentioned whilst answering question 9, I kept an eye out for VPN software
                        installed in any of the same researched folders or logged in the Prefetch files. Once again, no local installation of a VPN service could be identified.
                        Therefore, we stay with our scope focussing on Edge. Since no history could be found, I decided to also peruse the WebCacheV01.dat file, stored in
                        <span id="inline-code">C:\Users\PeterDProgrammer\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache</span> which can be analyzed with the BrowsingHistoryView tool
                        provided by NirSoft. No such luck however, and that's when I got reminded of Browser Extensions. These extensions are stored on the local system as well
                        in the folder <span id="inline-code">C:\Users\PeterDProgrammer\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Extensions</span>. The folder names are all
                        obfuscated and the quickest way to retrieve information on the installed extensions is by going into the <span id="inline-code">_locales</span> folder and
                        opening the <span id="inline-code">messages.json</span> file. By doing this, we discover that Prime VPN is used by Peter.

                        Figuring out the answer to this question proofed to be quite the challenge and you will need multiple puzzle pieces to solve it. First of all, refer
                        back to question 10, where we used the BrowsingHistoryView tool to analyze the WebCacheV01.dat file. Attentive people will have noticed that there were
                        references to files stored on the <span id="inline-code">D:\</span> drive as well as two files stored in Peter's Documents folder referring to BitLocker.
                        <img class="lazy" data-src="/img/btlo_thekey_q11_0.png" alt="q11_answer">
                        <br>
                        Additionally, from the challenge description we know that there is a secret drive that is encrypted. I was under the assumption that the secret drive
                        was attached in the E01 image as partition 4. However, I also noticed that the host OS has drives D, E, F and G which in other investigations has not
                        been the case. That's when I dived into the tools that are to our disposal and noticed that I hadn't used Arsenal Image Mounter so far, and in general
                        never used that piece of software before. I <a href="https://arsenalrecon.com/products/arsenal-image-mounter">read up</a> on it, and then figured out
                        that you can mount images to your location system. If we mount the disk image using the online mode, we see that all volumes are already mounted to
                        the four previous drives (D, E, F and G) that we had noticed earlier. Additionally, we identify that the second volume has a volume shadow copy.
                        <img class="lazy" data-src="/img/btlo_thekey_q11_1.png" alt="q11_answer">

                        A <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service">Volume Shadow Copy</a> are snapshots
                        captured by the operating system and store copies of files and volumes at specific points in time, enabling users to restore previous versions of
                        files or entire volumes. As such, playing a vital role in covering data that we need to solve this and likely the next questions. We can assume that
                        the volume containing the volume shadow copy is likely mounted to the <span id="inline-code">E:</span> drive, since the D and G drive are empty and F
                        is an encrypted volume.
                        <br>
                        We can use the command <span id="inline-code">vssadmin list shadows /for=E:</span> to obtain a list of shadow copies for the <span id="inline-code">E:</span>
                        drive drive. One copy is identified, which we would be able to restore using the make link command in Windows: <span id="inline-code">mklink /D C:\vssrestore \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\</span>.
                        Since we executed these commands in an administrator CMD session, we will use the terminal to dive into the contents, with the focus on the Documents folder.
                        In said folder, we identify the <span id="inline-code">Bit.TXT</span> file, which holds the Bitlocker Recovery Key.

                        We can use that key, to unlock BitLocker encrypted drive <span id="inline-code">F:</span> drive, by selecting to use the BitLocker Recovery Key. With the
                        access we have obtained, we can browse through the drive and identify Peter's project to be "Save Data Save World".

                        There are multiple file transfer services that work on Windows, however, from our research on both the VPN service and Password Manager, we should remember that we
                        saw that WinSCP was present in the <span id="inline-code">C:\Program Files (x86)</span> folder. WinSCP is the Windows-based secure copy program that can be used
                        as a network-based file transfer service. WinSCP stores some configuration and session details in the Windows registry for each user. Therefore, we acquire Peter's
                        <span id="inline-code">NTUSER.dat></span> file and examine it with FRED. Since it's a software package, we can search under the SOFTWARE key. Note that WinSCP
                        is developed by Martin Prikryl, which is the main key the WinSCP configuration and session data is stored under. We identify a Sessions key which contains
                        one object containing the username and hostname that were connected to: <span id="inline-code">ubuntu@172.16.0.16</span>
