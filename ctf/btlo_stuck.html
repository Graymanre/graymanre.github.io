          <p>
            Today we will be walking through one of the Blue Team Labs Online Investigations: Stuck. The Investigation is 
            rated as <b>"Hard"</b> and will earn you <b>100 points</b>. To earn full points, you have to answer 23 questions in regard to
            the following scenario:

                <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">John is an all-rounder in security, before holiday season he was assigned a lot of work. The work is to perform some security testing on a few applications. He worked day and night and created a rough report about the critical vulnerabilities he found in the given scope. The entire team was waiting for his report as everyone is eagerly waiting for the holidays. Unfortunately, john's thoughts on the holiday season made him click an EVIL executable which encrypted his system. After reading the RANSOM note John deleted it which was a blunder. Ransom Note contains the unique id and BITCOIN address which will be helpful in the worst case. It's a shock to the entire organization. Everyone was STUCK as that report and a private key saved in that PC are a major priority for the organization. There is no time to perform security testing again. there is no backup and CISO is not willing to pay ransom too. Only best part was security team was able to perform a live response and gather some important evidence. Now, it's your turn to help John as well as the entire Org. in decrypting the report and wish EveryOne Happy Holidays.</pre>

          <p>
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                  <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">Question 1) John's thoughts on the holiday season made him click an EVIL executable. What is the name of the EVIL file? (Format: filename.ext) (3 points)</pre>
                </div>
            </div> 
            We start this investigation by identifying which artifacts we have at our disposal in the evidence folder located on the Desktop. We see that we have a multide of files at our disposal.
            Amongst these are registry hives, encrypted files, a memory dump of the filesystem as well as the Windows Event Logs. Based on the scenario and this first question, we can safely assume
            that John executed the EVIL file, and we should be able to identify this through the Event logs. Here, we look for EventID 4688 in the Security log or for EventID 1 in the Syslog.
            <br><br>
            The Security Event Log does not yield any interesting results. As such, we will focus on the Sysmon Event Log. One will notice that there's quite a number of logs when narrowing 
            the search focus to EventID 1 only. Therefore, we work under the assumption that once the filesystem was encrypted, it is unlikely that many other programs would have been able to be executed.
            Therefore, we sort the logs from new to old and start with analyzing the newest log entry and work our way to the beginning of the logging sequence. 
            <br><br>
            The log entry created on 25.12.2021 at 2:36:21 PM denotes the execution of <span id="inline-code">DECRPYT.exe</span>. This might be the EVIL binary, but we assume this to be unlikely as based on it's name
            it is more likely to be a decrypting mechanism for the ransomware. Another interesting log entry is created on 25.12.2021 at 2:24:48 PM, when the binary <span id="inline-code">Wservices.exe</span>
            is executed from a questionable location: <span id="inline-code">C:\Users\Tester\AppData\Roaming\holidays</span>. Furthermore, we identify two additional log entries indicating the
            existence of an additional binary within that folder <span id="inline-code">HolidayPlanner.exe</span>. No other activity that could be assumed to be malicious is identified. So we focus our 
            efforts on these two specific binaries. Thanks to Sysmon, we can access the SHA256 hashes of both binaries within the log entries. A search on VirusTotal shows that both these binaries are 
            known-malicious.
            <br><br>
            Since <span id="inline-code">HolidayPlanner.exe</span> was executed before <span id="inline-code">Wservices.exe</span>, this is the EVIL executable.

                </div>
            </div> 
            If we remain in the log entry view of the Windows Event Viewer, we are already capable of obtaining the MD5 hash (<span id="inline-code">5911BD4CE6A3041D3D0E106D2604CC78</span>) of the binary, since this is included in the log entry of Sysmon Event ID 1 logs.
            In order to obtain the compiled date of the binary, we will utilize the memory dump in combination with volatility.
