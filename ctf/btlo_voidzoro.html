Q1) Search for Sysmon Event ID 1 and extension is ".js" -> "node.js"
Q2) See the event ID 1 and see that $env.paths is used for value "7zEO4RLPOXT3"
Q3) Take the shellcode, remove all spaces and commas, hex decode then base64 encode in cyberchef -> e48dab182fa3f47d088c562db0e44d31
Q4) 0xaadf0f1 & 0x3D8CAE3 -> https://pastebin.com/jsMiDgE1 -> VirtualAlloc, LoadLibraryA 
Q5) See first line, search for usage of $imageBuf, see that shellcode is copied into it -> nagateliteqfUK.exe
Q6) Payload on the machine at C:\ProgramData\Oracle\nagateliteqfUK.exe, then, locate where kerenl32 is used. You will see that it happens 3 times, of which twice in the same function. Read this blog, answer is: 0x401300. API hashing is often obfuscating kernel32 calls: https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/defense-evasion/windows-api-hashing-in-malware. So you search for kernel32 usage
Q7) Check the function that is called before the API Hashing function, looks like decryption -> 0x4016c0
Q8) Go into decryption function, identify that movzx ecx, byte ptr [eax+edx] will tell you in EAX the location of the key. Run and loop over, identifying length of key -> AB1A3887D0C71E5626BBA3E853D1C39657DE976D1CF0828F4DD3ACD6
Q9) Go into decryption function, identify that mov [edx], al will tell you that in EDX the decrypted data will be stored. First, we run the iteration twice, and monitor the output address. We see 4D5A, which resembles MZ, which is a MS EXE header.
    Now we run until the end, calculate the start of the buffer (EDX) + 39965 and then copy and save these bytes as an executable. Open the new executable in IDA, search for CreateMutex. See it exists only once.
    Set breakpoint, we don't get anywhere near, in the previous function, patch the last conditional check and set the ZF to 0x1. Then, break on lea eax, [ebp+VolumeSerialNumber], get the address. 
    Then break on ds:GetVolumeInformationW, step once, then change the value at [ebp+VolumeSerialNumber] to B3D63D45 (reverse of expected hex because memory), then jump to push eax at call ds:CreateMutexW -> {800520f3-60f3-ccf3-f3f3-f3f3f3f3f3f3}
Q10) String qE2PyNqQ was included in packets send to C2 server whilst dynamically debugging. Seemed static, lookup, see it is used to mark payload.
Q11) Read blog here: https://www.esentire.com/blog/unraveling-not-azorult-but-koi-loader-a-precursor-to-koi-stealer 
     Discover that first packet is irrelevant, look at second packet -> see it is send using format string |%s|%d.%d (%d)|%S|%S|%S -> see blog for OSMajor,OSMinor,OSBuild,Username,Computername.
     Search for computername call, then start reverse engineering
     Dynamically reverse and confirm this. Based on SYSMON and Wireshark (See LLMNR request for DESKTOP-2C2IQHO) -> brute force XOR -> key = 98 E0 25 C7 37 6C 1A E6 20 70 FE EF F4 18 97 A2 -> result is = `|10.0 (16299)|REM|DESKTOP-2C3IQHO|`
Q12) 
Q13) Function directly after the function of Q9, has another function in the last block, there you will see a description starting with "The Default Browser Agent task..." -> Firefox Default Browser Agent 318146B0AF4A39CB

          <h2 id="post__content__title">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Today we will be walking through one of the Blue Team Labs Online Investigations: VoidZoro. The Investigation is 
            rated as <b>"Hard"</b> and will earn you <b>100 points</b>. To earn full points, you have to answer 13 questions in regard to
            the following scenario:
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
              <div class="highlight">
                <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">The manufacturing company becomes the target of "VoidZoro," a notorious financially motivated threat actor group. This group initiates a sophisticated cyber attack by sending phishing emails to the company's employees. These emails cleverly impersonate internal communications from the IT department, urging employees to download a critical software update through an embedded link. Upon clicking the link, the download of a malicious payload is initiated. Your task is to reverse engineer the malicious payloads and determine the intentions of the threat actor.</pre>
              </div>
            </div>
          </p>
          <h2 id="post__content__title">JavaScript Execution</h2>
          <p>
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                  <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">Q1) The user ran the JavaScript file on the host; provide the name of the initial JavaScript file that the user executed (Format: file.js) (7 points)</pre>
                </div>
            </div> 
            Opening the Investigation folder shows that we have access to three log artificats: the Sysmon and PowerShell event logs and a WireShark capture. Since the user executed the JavaScript file, we can utilize the Sysmon Event Log and specifically
            investigate the events with Event ID 1, which corresponds to Process Creation events. Additionally, we will apply a filter searching for ".js" within the logs. When sorting ascending, the first log entry shows that the file "node.js" was executed
            by the "Administrator" using, using <span id="inline-code">wscript.exe</span>.
            <img src="../img/btlo_voidzoro_q1.png" alt="q1_answer">
          </p>
          <h2 id="post__content__title">Yara Search</h2>
          <p>
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                  <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">Q2) Now, using Yara, find the malicious JavaScript on the machine (Note: it is under a different name). Provide the value of the mutex name (Format: Mutex Name) (7 points)</pre>
                </div>
            </div> 
            My first thought was to get the MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hashes of the script. However, using these hashes as the main search method within the Yara script, no results were returned.
            So let's further analyze the event that we have identified to answer question 1. We identify that the parent process of <span id="inline-code">wscript.exe</span> is 
            <span id="inline-code">powershell.exe</span>. The PowerShell process executes two PowerShell files which are obtained from a remote source. To me, the <span id="inline-code">$env:paths = '7zEO4RLPOXT3'</span>
            stands out, since we see no further usage of it within the PowerShell command. I had the hunch that this might be (part of) the path where the malicious JavaScript was stored. 
            So, we create a new Yara script, focussing on identifying all files that have the string '7zEO4RLPOXT3' in their full path. As such, we identify that this string indeed was
            used as a mutex name for the JavaScript file.
          </p>
          <h2 id="post__content__title">Shellcode Hash</h2>
          <p>
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                  <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">Q3) You should know how to find the main PowerShell payload now pivoting from the JavaScript execution or file content. Find the file on the host using normal search. The PowerShell script contains the shellcode, provide the MD5 hash for the shellcode payload (Format: MD5) (7 points)</pre>
                </div>
            </div> 
            Once again, we build upon our discovered log entry from question 1. In the specific log, we identify two unique URLs that are hosting two separate PowerShell scripts. Analyzing both URLs, we only identify a shellcode blob in the <span id="inline-code">sheilingUe02.ps1</span> script. We copy
            this blob of shellcode, and perform some data manipulation by removing all spaces, commas and "0x". Next, using CyberChef, we hex-decode the data and then calculate the MD5 hash, resulting in the answer: e48dab182fa3f47d088c562db0e44d31.
            <img src="../img/btlo_voidzoro_q3_2.png" alt="q3_answer">
            <img src="../img/btlo_voidzoro_q3.png" alt="q3_answer">
          </p>
          <h2 id="post__content__title">Shellcode APIs</h2>
          <p>
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                  <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">Q4) Analyze the shellcode. Find all the APIs that are hidden (Format: API1, API2) (7 points)</pre>
                </div>
            </div> 
            We will remain in CyberChef for the moment, as we want to transform the shellcode into a more readable format. To do this, we will remove all current recipes and drag in the "Disassemble x86" recipe. This allows us to transform the shellcode from binary
            into disassembly format, giving us the instructions that can be parsed in IDA. Apply the "Disassemble x86" recipe, set the bit mode to 32 and then save the output to a file. 
            <br><br>
            With the disassembly in hand, we can load the file into IDA and continue our analysis. At a first glance, we see that all <span id="inline-code">call</span> instructions will call an address that is stored in a registry. This obfuscates a quick static analysis process. 
            <br><br>
            Additionally, I am going to investigate if, based on the usage of <span id="inline-code">FS:[30]</span>, some form of API hashing is taking place in correlation to the instructions at offset <span id="inline-code">0x22</span>, <span id="inline-code">0x2E</span> and <span id="inline-code">0x3D</span>. 
            <br><img src="../img/btlo_voidzoro_q4_1.png" alt="q4_answer"><br><br>
            This technique is well documented, and in relation to shellcode, the target library whose function calls are hashed is kernel32.dll. We can confirm this by diving deeper into API hashing. For detailed information please refer to these great blogs by <a href="https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/09/02/anatomy-and-disruption-of-metasploit-shellcode/">nviso</a> and <a href="https://decoded.avast.io/threatintel/decoding-cobalt-strike-understanding-payloads/">avast</a>.
            <br><br>
            Let's first set the scene by defining some abbrevations and terms:
            <br>
            <b>TEB</b> = Thread Environment Block
            <br>
            <b>PEB</b> = Process Environment Block
            <br>
            <b>PEB_LDR_DATA</b> = Structure within PEB
            <br>
            <b>InMemoryOrderModuleList</b> = Double linked list within PEB_LDR_DATA containing pointers to an LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY structure.
            <br>
            <b>LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY</b> = structure containing information on a specific loaded module.
            <br><br>
            Shellcode often interacts with the PEB, which is located inside of the TEB. The PEB holds a structure called PEB_LDR_DATA. The PEB_LDR_DATA structure contains a doubly-linked list called InMemoryOrderModuleList which allows for 
            iteration through each LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY structure. Each specific LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY structure, corresponds to a loaded module, containing a field called <span id="inline-code">BaseDLLName</span> which corresponds to the name of the loaded module/DLL. 
            Using the BaseDLLName, the shellcode can identify all exported functions.
            <br><br>
            As mentioned before the usage of <span id="inline-code">FS:[30]</span> stood out to me, because that specific location points to the TEB address, which the shellcode obtains to perform API hashing.
            We see that three hashes are used in the shellcode: 0xB3C1D03, 0xAADF0F1 and 0x3D8CAE3. Multiple websites record rainbow tables of hashes and corresponding functions in common DLLs. Using <a href="https://pastebin.com/jsMiDgE1">this</a> pastebin, we identify
            these functions as: GetProcAddress, LoadLibraryA and VirtualAlloc respectively. However, the question only asks for two hidden APIs. Since GetProcAddress is used to resolve the addresses of other functions, the two hidden APIs are LoadLibraryA and VirtualAlloc.
            <br>
            <img src="../img/btlo_voidzoro_q4_2.png" alt="q4_answer">
          </p>
          <h2 id="post__content__title">Shellcode Payload</h2>
          <p>
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                  <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">Q5) You know that the shellcode allocates the memory for the payload. What is the name of the payload? (Format: filename.ext) (7 points)</pre>
                </div>
            </div> 
            To answer this question, we will refocus on the PowerShell script <span id="inline-code">sheilingUe02.ps1</span>. The script starts by downloading an executable from <span id="inline-code">https[:]//prayas.co/assets/nagateliteqfUK.exe</span>. 
            <br>
            <img src="../img/btlo_voidzoro_q5_1.png" alt="q5_answer">
            <br><br>
            The contents of this executable is stored in the value <span id="inline-code">$image</span>, which is later used to copy into the memory allocated by the shellcode. Therefore, the name of the payload is: <span id="inline-code">nagateliteqfUK.exe</span>.
            <br>
            <img src="../img/btlo_voidzoro_q5_2.png" alt="q5_answer">
          </p>
          <h2 id="post__content__title">Payload Location</h2>
          <p>
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                  <pre class="highlight" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">Q6) Now locate the payload on the machine using Search. Provide the address of the function where the API hashing takes place for the secondary payload (Format: 0x Address) (7 points)</pre>
                </div>
            </div> 
            Using the exact instructions of the question, we will open the Windows File Explorer and use the Search functionality to search for the executable with the name <span id="inline-code">nagateliteqfUK</span>. Search will give us one result, which locates the executable in the folder:
            <span id="inline-code">C:\ProgramData\Oracle\</span>. 
            <br><br>
            The question refers to API hashing, which we already covered whilst answering Q4. We are looking for the function, where the API hashing took place. If you want to follow along, ensure you have set your base to 0x400000 in IDA.
            We will drop into the <span id="inline-code">main</span> function at <span id="inline-code">0x402F40</span>. 
            <br><br>
            The function starts of with some anti-debugging measures, one of which is the call to BuildCommDCBAndTimeoutsA with the first argument being the string <span id="inline-code">jhl46745fghb</span>. This call aims to translate a device-definition
            string like <span id="inline-code">jhl46745fghb</span> into an appropriate device-control block. In any normal setting, this call should fail, however emulation environments may try to satisfy this requirement and that would trigger a program termination by the malware.
            <br><br>
            We will follow the normal execution flow which continues by calling function <span id="inline-code">sub_401710</span> is called. We will thoroughly analyze what happens here. To make it easier for those following along, please refer to the disassembly below:
            <img src="../img/btlo_voidzoro_q6_1.png" alt="q6_answer">
            <br>

            The function <span id="inline-code">sub_401710</span> starts off with two calls to <span id="inline-code">sub_401110</span>. Inside <span id="inline-code">sub_401110</span>, we see the malware obtaining a handle to the <span id="inline-code">kernel32.dll</span> DLL, and three calls with the handle and what appears to be API hashes. The handles that are returned,
            are then used to call these specific functions...
